      <p class="extended lead-text first-element">Our business objectives are centred around enhancing customer retention and minimising churn rates through the fine-tuning of existing platform user experience and functionality. Our focus is on substantially boosting net retention whilst reducing downsell rates. This will be achieved by simplifying the process of adding services or upgrades for our customers and diligently eradicating friction points that could hinder this process.</p>
      <p>We are dedicated to strengthening the capabilities of the Engagement Builder by launching Audience, a tool designed to not only refine and personalise the user experience for our customers but also to match or exceed the segmentation offerings provided by our competitors.</p>
      <p>Alongside delivering superior product features, we're equally focused on the effective communication of value, ensuring our customers consistently understand the inherent value of our products and perceive the opportunities for future service enhancement or upgrade. In summary, our objectives are geared towards promoting customer loyalty, stimulating upselling and encouraging greater platform usage.</p>

      <p class="lead-text" id="improve-existing">Improve the existing UX and functionality to boost customer retention, reduce churn, and increase upsell value</p>
      <p>Our primary business objective is to use superior user experience within the platform as the main driver to stabilise the downsell and churn rates of our existing customers. By enhancing the user experience and functionality of the existing platform, we can help in achieving our goals to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve net retention from 97% to 110%</li>
        <li>Decrease downsell rate to less than 0.5%</li>
        <li>Reduce the churn rate to less than 3%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will achieve these targets by creating intuitive user pathways for easy upgrading or addition of services, and reducing friction by understanding the pain points of our existing users. This approach will foster customer loyalty, encourage upselling, and increase profitability and usage of the platform â€“ all pivotal for achieving our 20% growth target in 2025.</p>
    
    <p class="numeral">2.</p>
      <p class="lead-text" id="increase-adoption">Increase the adoption and functionality of Engagement Builder and Audience</p>
      <p>75% of our revenue comes from customers which actively use Engagement Builder. They perfectly match our automotive B2B2C ICP, and they do not churn, year after year. Improving the UX and functionality in this area will be vital to our efforts to grow our SAM. Engagement Builder is powerful, but to shift into the next gear, we will be introducing Audience which will enable our customers to understand their consumers like never before. It will allow our customers to finely and precisely segment their audiences and target each of them with personalised engagements using Engagement Builder.</p>
    
    <p class="numeral">3.</p>
      <p class="lead-text" id="continual-value">Continual Value Communication</p>
      <p>Besides delivering valuable product features, it is also vital to effectively communicate this value to our customers, influencing them to invest more with us. This would contribute to reduced down-sell as well as increased retention. Delivering value to our customers extends beyond simply delivering superior product features. It is equally critical to effectively articulate and communicate this value to our customers on a continual basis. This enhanced communication strategy will not only allow our customers to better understand our product's value to their organisation but can also serve to underline the opportunities for expansion/upgrade of services.</p>

        <p class="lead-text">Stabilise the current UX of the existing platform</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Optimise the existing platform&#39;s user experience by identifying and prioritising its issues based on the business objectives, to decrease user churn and provide a solid foundation before adding new features.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Incorporate the new branding as quickly as possible</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Swiftly implement the new branding, including any changes in product names, to minimise disruption and enable normal service to resume, given its wide-ranging impact on all subsequent work.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Investigate and set up semi-regular user seminars/surgeries</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Establish semi-regular user seminars to facilitate direct communication between users and in-house team for deeper insight into product usage and feedback, enhancing product transparency and fostering a small, approachable tech company image.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Actively deprecate Classic Freespee</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Phase out Classic Freespee, allowing customer operations solely in New Freespee. Restrict new customer access to Classic Freespee and transition most often used features to New Freespee, using PostHog to identify them. This will ensure consistent service provision and unify internal development efforts.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">More responsive platform</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Enhance the platform&#39;s capability to handle large data sets to ensure reliability for major users. This not only facilitates selling of the platform but also encourages user retention, increasing their exposure to additional solutions, as users can manage their data directly on the platform without needing to manipulate it elsewhere.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Introduce a realtime datastream into the platform</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Launch a real-time data stream view in the platform to display ongoing activities, such as phone calls or scheduled events, thus increasing platform usage. This meets customer expectations for real-time event management and enhances data accessibility, changing Freespee from a historically &#39;stale&#39; platform to a dynamic, current one.</p></p>

        <p class="lead-text">Redesigned Engagement Builder home to be more useful</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Redesign the Engagement Builder home page to include better visibility, sortability, and filterability of workflows, along with upfront display of workflow-related data. Also, provide an overview, case-based help videos, and data on most-active workflows and total deliveries to emphasise the significance and potential of workflows.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Workflows will be enhanced</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Revamp and enhance workflows to be more useful and competitive, introducing more custom actions, logical operators, stacked rules, quickstart industry-based templates, and options for simple and advanced modes. This is vital as workflows have high potential but are presently limited by their build structure, making competitors&#39; workflow builders appear richer and more powerful.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Audience will be expanded</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Expand audience features to incorporate more data beyond criteria, including audience size, time trends and single-occasion actions. This makes audience data more comprehensive and measurable over time.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Introduce email as a trackable service</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Introduce email as a trackable service that utilises alias emails, similar to FS numbers, and allows FS to mediate customer-consumer interactions, enabling further tracking and personalisation of engagement. This simple product expansion will facilitate tracking of multi-channel user journeys and be easily marketable by CSMs.</p></p>

        <p id="plan-communication" class="plan-objective text-coral-candy" style="visibility: hidden; margin-top: 100px;">Continual Value Communication</p>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Understand usage of the current product roster</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Analyse current product usage to identify underused tools for potential deprecation, streamlining the platform. The gathered data will also highlight absent platform functionality, directing the development of solutions for these services, and will help us to reduce our reliance on single team members.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">The current platform is a complex tool with a lot of possibilities and solutions</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Refurbish the Solution Library to demonstrate each product with a dummy account acting and receiving data like a real one. Each solution should be demonstrable via the Experience/Demo website and measurable in the dummy account, serving not only potential customers but also providing efficient product introductions for new employees.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">More information about potential upgrades/solutions should be available in more places in the platform</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Maximise visibility of potential upgrades/solutions across the platform, instead of limiting them to the Solution Library. These products should be promoted at relevant points, pushing for self-sale over reliance on CSMs. Coupled with the demo platform, CSMs or self-evaluating customers can trial potential solutions without resorting to free trials.</p></p>
        <hr>
    
        <p class="lead-text">Latest News section in the platform to highlight updates and changes, as well as important industry news</p>
        <p class="body-text"><p>Implement a &#39;Latest News&#39; section on the platform to passively provide updates on new features, changes, and relevant industry news, offering a more effective communication solution than the current &#39;Tutorial Modal&#39;, which is often dismissed. This section can also function as the much-needed changelog.</p></p>
